# 🛍️ Artisan-e-Commerce Platform

## 🧵 Problem
**Rural artisans struggle to sell their handmade products to a broader audience.**  
Due to lack of technical knowledge, digital exposure, and access to marketplaces, artisans often rely on middlemen, resulting in low profits and limited market reach.

This project is a **comprehensive e-commerce platform built using the MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), specifically designed to empower rural artisans by enabling them to sell their handmade products directly to a wider audience.

**Key objectives:**
- Multilingual support for inclusivity
- Easy onboarding process for non-tech-savvy users
- Secure payment gateway integration
- Efficient logistics and order tracking
- Storytelling feature for each product and artisan
- Fair price suggestion engine
